# Costi-Incorperated
This is a website I created around 2018 and was the predecessor to Costi Online an entire 6 years before its release. This website was unfortunately never published, but you can observe various design elements and features that are reflected even in the latest release of Costi Online. This project was meant to centralize all my interest and showcase them for others.

## Entertainment
What we know now as Costi Media used to be called Costi Entertainment when this website was created. This feature has a similar purpose to the modern day Costi Online equivalent. It showcases various media series I created over time.

## ASAS
This was a page dedicated to a teaser for ASAS 2018, a party I hosted annually after school ended. This page featured an innovative video based banner I liked so much, I used this idea for Costi Online.
